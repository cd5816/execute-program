// We can write object keys as unquoted words like Amir in this example:

// const loginCount = { Amir: 5 };
// loginCount.Amir; // 5

// We can also create objects with computed keys. To do that, wrap the key in square brakcets: { [someVariable]: 1 }

const name = "Amir";
const loginCounts = { [name]: 5 };
loginCounts.Amir; // 5
// The expression inside the square brackets is evaluated and the result is used as the property name (key).
// In the example above, the name variable pointed to 'Amir', so the key was 'Amir'.
// But property names can be anything, not just variables.
